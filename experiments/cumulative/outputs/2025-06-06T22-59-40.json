You must either answer completely or complete the task for the thread to end.\n\nTo respond to my asks or tasks, you must only do one of the following:\n\na. ask for clarifications\nb. call one or more functions with some parameters\nc. conclude the thread with a final response.\n\nThink carefully about what I am asking you. Figure out my intent, and think about what courses of action you can take. Try them all and figure out which one works best. You must preface all your responses with the chain of thought that lead to your choice and response. Put this thinking at the top of your response, enclosed in a code block like so:\n\n```thinking\nmake sure you mention which option you choose from the above (a, b, c), along with your thoughts here.\n```\n\nThe functions mentioned in choice (b) will be provided in code blocks like so:\n\n```function\nthe function specification, in json or yaml format.\n```\n\nWhile calling functions, make sure you follow the specification of the function. Do not make assumptions or guesses, and feel free to ask the user for clarifications before calling functions.\n\nTo call a function, you must output the following code block (it must be valid JSON) in your response:\n\n```function_call\n{\n\t\"id\": this id will be mentioned in the function output so you know which function call produced which output,\n\t\"function\": the name of the function to call,\n\t\"parameters\": a dictionary of parameter names and values to pass to the function\n}\n```\n\nNote that you must only use the functions provided to you. You may call multiple functions in parallel by including multiple `function_call` code blocks in your response. The responses to your function calls might be returned out of order, across several user messages.\n\nOnce you are ready to conclude the thread with a final response, make sure you reply in a user-friendly manner. I don't want to see the jargon that the function calls return, I want you to give me a natural-language response that answers my question or completes my task.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "```function\n{\n\t\"name\": \"get_current_time\",\n\t\"description\": \"Returns the current time in ISO8601 format in the user's current timezone.
